The Restaurant Management System (RMS) presented in this project leverages PHP and MySQLi to streamline operations and elevate customer experience in the food service industry. In a dynamic and competitive market, effective management tools are essential for optimizing resources, enhancing productivity, and ensuring customer satisfaction

This system incorporates key modules designed to address various aspects of restaurant
operations, including menu management, order processing, inventory control, table management,
and customer relationship management. Through an intuitive user interface, restaurant staff can
efficiently manage menu items, modify prices, and update availability in real-time. Orders are
seamlessly processed, tracked, and dispatched to the kitchen, minimizing errors and reducing
service time.
Inventory management functionalities enable inventory tracking, stock level monitoring, and
automated reordering to ensure seamless supply chain operations. Table management features
facilitate efficient seating arrangements, reservation handling, and table turnover optimization,
contributing to a smooth dining experience for patrons.
Moreover, the system offers robust reporting and analytics capabilities, enabling stakeholders to
gain insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. These
insights empower informed decision-making and strategic planning for business growth and
customer retention.
